# LinkedOut
A replication of the popular LinkedIn social media website created using React to render the front-end view and a Express server connected to a MongoDB instance to handle read/writes to the database.

## Core Features
- None yet...

## How To Run Locally:
- The `.env` file in the `server` directory should contain the following fields:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=${PRIVATE_KEY}
MONGODB_URI=${URI}
PORT=${PORT_NUMBER}
```

## What's Next?
- Replace Firebase hosting and database with GitHub Pages and MongoDB
- Replace plain CSS files with Tailwind CSS
- Move rendering to server side with Next.js?
